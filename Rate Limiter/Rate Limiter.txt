1) Funational Requirement
  a) before the calling any API the client would check with limilter
  b) Do we want to implement client side or server side limiter --> server side
  c) Rate limiter should support globally.

2) Non-Functional requirement
  a) Scalable
  b) Highly available
  c) Low Latency
  d) Consistent

3) Assumptions and estimations
  1) 10 million users/application to use the rate limiter
  2) 50 million requests on daily basis per user/application
  
  QPS = 50 X 10^6/10^5 = 500
  
  storgare = 10 X 10^6 X 50 bytes = 500MB
  
  4) High Level Design
  
  User --> Web Server --> App Server --> Database
            |
            |
            Rate Limiter
 
 
 GetNode API    5 times in a day
 SetNode API    10 timde in day
 
 Map
 GetNode --> counter
 
 
  5) Detailed Design
  
  user --> LB --> (Web Server) X 10 --> AppServer--> Database
                  |
                  |
                  LB (Rate Limiter) X 10 ---> Redis
                                              GetNode --> counter
